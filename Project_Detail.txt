PROJECT 1: AUTHENTICATION & USER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

(Weeks 1–4 | Foundation Project)

Objective

Demonstrate secure backend design, Spring Security mastery, and frontend authentication flow.
This project answers the question:

“Can you build a production-ready login system?”

1. Functional Requirements
User Roles

USER

ADMIN

User Capabilities

Register

Login

Access own profile

Logout (token-based)

Refresh access token

Admin Capabilities

View all users

Enable / disable user accounts

Assign roles

2. Backend – What Exactly to Build
Database Design
User
- id (UUID)
- name
- email (unique)
- password
- role (ENUM)
- enabled (boolean)
- createdAt

RefreshToken
- id
- token
- user_id
- expiryDate

API Endpoints
POST   /api/auth/register
POST   /api/auth/login
POST   /api/auth/refresh
GET    /api/users/me
GET    /api/admin/users
PUT    /api/admin/users/{id}/disable

Security Architecture

Spring Security Filter Chain

JWT authentication filter

Stateless session

BCrypt password hashing

Role-based authorization (@PreAuthorize)

Internal Architecture
controller/
service/
repository/
dto/
entity/
security/
exception/
config/

Key Concepts You MUST Implement

DTO ↔ Entity mapping

Global exception handling

Validation using @Valid

Custom JWT filter

Token expiration handling

3. Frontend – What Exactly to Build
Pages

Login

Register

Dashboard

Admin Panel

Behavior

Store JWT securely

Protect routes

Auto logout on token expiry

Role-based UI rendering

4. Interview Value

You can explain:

JWT flow end-to-end

Security filter chain

Why stateless auth is used

Password hashing strategy
